# IGP Clone App

## Overview

The IGP Sismo App is a web application that provides access to earthquake data obtained from the Instituto de Geofísica del Peru (IGP). It offers various features to explore earthquake information, visualize seismic events on maps, and download earthquake datasets.

## Features

- **Latest Earthquake**: Displays the most recent earthquake information similar to what is shown on the [IGP's last earthquake page](https://ultimosismo.igp.gob.pe/).
